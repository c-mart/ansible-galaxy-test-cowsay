Cowsay
=========

Trivial role installs and tests cowsay on CentOS 6+, Ubuntu 12.04+, and possibly others. Created to learn Ansible Galaxy, writing roles for multiple distros, and Travis testing.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

---
- name: test playbook runs cowsay role
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - cowsay
